MartianChain L1 — Competitive Research + Tooling/Docs Plan (Locked Scope)
Generated: 2025-12-27

===============================================================================
0) Purpose of this document
===============================================================================
Capture the tasks, ideas, plans, research notes, and raw data produced in this chat
so they can be shared inside the new project and used as a scope anchor to prevent
scope creep.

Primary goals stated by user:
- Identify tools/apps/code/docs from other Avalanche L1s that can be duplicated
  (legally + clean-room implementation, using public/free materials).
- Perform a competitive dive: progress + popularity signals for each L1.
- Upgrade MartianChain docs/tools to outshine competition and win Ava Labs grants.
- Create a Base44 prompt to ship publish-ready docs and initial tooling.
- (This file) Lock down the research output + tasks/backlog.

===============================================================================
1) Avalanche L1s in scope (from user list)
===============================================================================
- GUNZ (Gunzilla): https://gunbygunz.com/
- Numbers Protocol: https://numbersprotocol.io/
- Dexalot: https://dexalot.com/en
- PlayA3ull: https://playa3ull.games/
- Step.app: https://step.app/
- Beam: https://onbeam.com/developers
- MSU: https://msu.io/
- Numine: https://numine.io/
- Coq Inu / CoqNet: https://www.coqinu.com/

===============================================================================
2) What MartianChain has publicly today (observed during research)
===============================================================================
- MartianChain docs include essential network configuration:
  - Chain IDs, Subnet/Blockchain IDs
  - RPC + WebSocket endpoints
  - Contract addresses (validator-related)
- MartianScan explorer exists and shows chain highlights & activity UI
- martianchain.com advertises a micro-ecosystem with:
  - Token Viewer
  - Wallet connect + balance (placeholder)
  - Testnet Faucet

Interpretation:
- Network basics are present publicly.
- Biggest gap is a “builder funnel” layer:
  Quickstarts, templates, SDKs, status page, indexer/explorer API docs,
  operator docs, and a coherent productized dev portal.

===============================================================================
3) Copyable / reproducible patterns seen across stronger Avalanche L1s
===============================================================================
These are “low legal risk” patterns because they are generic and commonly
implemented; do NOT copy branding or proprietary code/UX.

(1) Canonical “Connect to Network” page
- Must include: chain ID, RPC/WSS, explorer, wallet add instructions
- Ideally: Chainlist presence + one-click MetaMask add (EIP-3085)

(2) Public status page
- Track: RPC, WSS, Explorer, Faucet, Docs, Indexer/API, Bridge
- Uptime transparency boosts trust (developers, wallets, infra partners)

(3) Operator-grade faucet
- Multiple faucet options where possible
- Bot resistance / rate limiting
- Docs page: “how to get funded” + limitations

(4) Explorer/scanner UX
- Token/NFT pages, holder lists, transfer views
- “Developer debugging” guidance: find txs, decode errors, receipts

(5) SDK + API wrappers (especially TS + C#)
- TS is default for web3; C# is a strong wedge for game studios (Unity)
- “Network constants” should be generated from a single source of truth

(6) Operator docs even for permissioned networks
- How to run nodes / track subnet / monitoring
- Publishing runbooks increases credibility and eases partnership

===============================================================================
4) Competitive snapshot (high-level)
===============================================================================
This snapshot reflects public “builder credibility” signals: docs quality, tooling,
operational transparency, shipped products, and visible usage indicators.

Top-tier (builder credibility)
- GUNZ: big product surface (wallet SDKs, scanner, marketplace, minting engine API),
  permissioned deployment posture. Strong “turnkey gaming infra” positioning.
- Beam: SDK/API posture (notably TS + C#), developer-first onboarding and chain-info hygiene.
- Numbers Protocol: strong docs + operational transparency (status page, runbooks). High trust signal.

Mid-tier (real products, lighter dev stack)
- Dexalot: strong product (exchange). Has chainlist hygiene and onboarding checklists.
- Step: consumer-app first, chain underneath; publishes node/build hints publicly.

Niche / ecosystem plays
- Playa3ull: operator clarity; currently not open to third-party validators (per docs).
- MSU: major brand gravity; third-party explorer/data support posture.
- Numine: network overview + connection params; game L1 lane.
- Coq Inu / CoqNet: attention + community engine; builder infra positioning via partners.

Competitive implications:
- MartianChain can win by being the “open, builder-first L1” with the best public
  onboarding + OSS tooling, not by trying to out-market major gaming brands.

===============================================================================
5) “Steal this” list per L1 (feature inspirations to replicate cleanly)
===============================================================================

A) GUNZ (Gunzilla)
Replicable patterns:
- “Developer Products” landing page with concrete offerings.
- Runbook-style chain docs: RPC options, chainlist, explorer, operational notes.
- Scanner UX: token/NFT/account views (front-end + indexer).
Avoid:
- Do not copy closed-source product implementations (minting engine, marketplace, wallet SDKs).
- Do not copy branding/assets/text.

B) Numbers Protocol
Replicable patterns:
- Docs IA: Users vs Developers vs Operators.
- Status page across infra components.
- Multiple faucet options.
- Public runbooks (subnet operations topics).

C) Beam
Replicable patterns:
- SDK-first strategy: TypeScript + C# wrapper libraries.
- Chain-info repository approach.
- “API + SDK” marketing posture for builders.

D) Dexalot
Replicable patterns:
- “Subnet checklist” onboarding page (2-minute setup).
- Chain registry hygiene + chainlist entry.

E) Step Network
Replicable patterns:
- Publish “node build” posture; public repo(s) for node/build configs (where safe).

F) Playa3ull
Replicable patterns:
- Operator clarity: subnet tracking config snippets.
- Validator program page (even if curated/closed).

G) MSU
Replicable patterns:
- Use at least one external explorer/indexing/data partner and document as “official”.

H) Numine
Replicable patterns:
- GitBook-like network overview template: confirmations, gas model, rate limits, archive nodes.

I) Coq Inu / CoqNet
Replicable patterns:
- Ecosystem directory that drives perceived momentum.
- Builder infra “incubator” posture.

===============================================================================
6) MartianChain upgrade backlog (prioritized, “highest leverage”)
===============================================================================
Phase 1 — Builder onboarding (must-haves)
1) Chainlist entry + 1-click “Add Network”
2) “Deploy in 5 minutes” quickstart:
   - Hardhat + Foundry, copy/paste ready
3) Faucet improvements:
   - bot resistance + rate limiting
   - clear documentation
4) Explorer docs:
   - verification guidance (only if supported)
   - API endpoints (if available)
   - token/NFT pages quality

Phase 2 — Tooling moat (grant-friendly)
5) Public status page
6) TypeScript SDK + C# SDK
   - network constants + helper functions
7) Public “network info” repo
8) Postman collection for RPC + custom endpoints

Phase 3 — Differentiation
9) Position as “open builder L1”
10) Open-source scanner UI starter kit
11) Ecosystem directory + bounties / hackathons winners list

===============================================================================
7) Grants narrative (how to package the work)
===============================================================================
Grant-friendly framing:
- “We shipped an Avalanche L1 with public RPC/WSS + explorer”
- “We open-sourced the developer funnel: SDKs, templates, Postman, status page, faucet”
- “We can prove adoption with measurable metrics:
   deployments, unique deployers, tx volume, ecosystem projects”

===============================================================================
8) Base44 deliverable (what was requested & produced)
===============================================================================
A highly specified Base44 prompt was produced to create a publish-ready
MartianChain Developer Portal with:
- Public docs site + Tools pages
- A single-source-of-truth `NetworkConfig` registry table
- Admin edit + audit log (`NetworkConfigChangeLog`)
- MetaMask add-network button (EIP-3085)
- RPC health checker tool (eth_blockNumber ping, response time, WSS connect test)
- Export network JSON tool
- Docs pages:
  Overview, Quickstart, Wallet setup, RPC/WSS, Explorer, Contracts & Addresses,
  Dev Recipes (read/send/events), Troubleshooting, Changelog

Core principle:
- “Build the tool first” (network registry + SDK constants), then use the tool to
  build subsequent features.
